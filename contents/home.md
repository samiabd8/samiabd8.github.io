I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I am advised by Professor [[Brennan Thompson]](https://www.torontomu.ca/economics/people/faculty/brennan-thompson/). My research involves bridging the gaps between <strong>structural econometrics and machine learning tools used for causal inference</strong>, with empirical applications in finance. I currently work as a graduate research assistant to Professor [[Nikola Gradojevic]](https://www.uoguelph.ca/lang/people/nikola-gradojevic), the Fidelity Chair in Finance at the University of Guelph.
